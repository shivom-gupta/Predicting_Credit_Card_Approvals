# Credit Card Approval Predictor

### Overview

Credit card application processing is a critical task for commercial banks, where they must quickly and accurately assess the risk of approving or rejecting each application. Traditionally, this process is manual, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to automate this process by developing a machine learning model to predict the approval status of credit card applications.

This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and utilizes the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of both numerical and categorical features, typical of those found in credit card applications. These features include:

- **Gender**
- **Age**
- **Debt**
- **Marital Status**
- **Bank Customer**
- **Education Level**
- **Ethnicity**
- **Years Employed**
- **Prior Default**
- **Employment Status**
- **Credit Score**
- **Driver's License**
- **Citizenship**
- **Zip Code**
- **Income**
- **Approval Status** (Target variable)

Before building the machine learning model, the dataset will undergo several preprocessing steps, such as feature selection, missing value handling, and data encoding, to ensure it is in the best shape for model training.

### Notebook Structure

1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:**  
   - Import the dataset and perform an initial inspection to understand the structure and content of the data.

2. **Data Inspection:**  
   - Analyze the features to identify key patterns, outliers, and missing values.

3. **Data Splitting:**  
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure that the model's performance can be fairly evaluated.

4. **Missing Values Handling:**  
   - Address any missing data points using appropriate imputation techniques to prevent bias in the model.

5. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Prepare the data by encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and performing any additional necessary transformations.

6. **Feature and Target Selection:**  
   - Separate the dataset into input features (X) and the target variable (y) for model training.

7. **Encoding Categorical Features:**  
   - Convert non-numerical features into numerical formats using encoding methods like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

8. **Data Scaling:**  
   - Normalize or standardize the feature values to ensure that the model's performance is not affected by varying scales of different features.

9. **Model Building:**  
   - Construct a machine learning model using appropriate algorithms to predict the approval status of credit card applications.

10. **Model Evaluation:**  
    - Assess the model's accuracy and performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

11. **Conclusion:**  
    - Summarize the results, discuss the model's strengths and weaknesses, and suggest potential areas for future improvement.
