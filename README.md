# Credit Card Approval Predictor

Commercial banks receive a lot of credit card applications that need to be analyzed to determine whether to approve or reject them. This task is usually done manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. In this Jupyter Notebook, we will build a machine learning model that can predict whether a credit card application will be approved or not. We will use the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset

The dataset contains both numerical and non-numerical features. The possible features in a typical credit card application are Gender, Age, Debt, Married, BankCustomer, EducationLevel, Ethnicity, YearsEmployed, PriorDefault, Employed, CreditScore, DriversLicense, Citizen, ZipCode, Income, and ApprovalStatus.

Before we start building the machine learning model, we will preprocess the dataset to ensure that it is suitable for machine learning. We will remove some features that are not as important as others and handle missing values.
